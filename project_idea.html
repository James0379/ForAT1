<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  I am passionate about coding and learning new languages as well as playing games. I would like to see a <q>full dive system</q> which is a broad concept from virtual reality where you feel the game. A project that will help me develop some skills, experience, and knowledge in order to make me another step closer to my ideal job. My project idea has to do with making a game in roblox because it can be coded in Lua which is a coding language which will help me in the learning steps of getting towards my ideal job. The innovation of the game I will be creating will be that I would create a game that firstly, has puzzles and hopefully more of a learning curve than most games. The idea is that there are a bunch of puzzles and the main goal is to get to the end while getting through puzzles, I will also have to build models and much more stuff that I haven't done before.

  My motivation
</h2>
<p>
  to do this my motivation comes from my interest / hobbies with gaming, previous learning with coding and parent has my ideal job. My dad is a senior analyst developer currently and can do many roles. To get to that stage it will take lots of experience, learning many languages, time, and learning with teams. I think this could possibly be useful because people that make roblox games can sell the games for currency, which then can be later traded into real life money. <q>This week a roblox representative said that developers and creators earned more than $500 million dollars in the year 2021.</q> (Roblox developers and creators earned over $500m in Robux during 2021. 2022 / Jeffrey Rousseau)

  Description
</h2>
<p>
  The features of the game will start with the character walking up to a hedge maze which changes once they walk in. When the character walks in the door will shut off behind them and a timer will appear at the top of the screen and a sound effect of a roar will appear behind the character, which the user will have a certain amount of time to do a puzzle with a monster chasing them. The puzzle will be simple because of the fact that they are getting chased but it will introduce them to somewhat of a challenge and will prepare them for the boss before getting to the end. The puzzle that will be introduced will be simple pulling levers throughout the maze and at the beginning of the maze there will be a photo of a map of the maze so the user doesn’t get lost.
Once they get through this maze it will slow down the pace of the game then puzzles will appear and there will be hints and some teaching curves for the user to use to get through the puzzles and progress. The puzzles will be tricky but will have a learning moment before getting to the actual puzzle because the majority of players on roblox are young players, expecting that they can learn something simple but with the concepts more simplified. The timer will be long enough to not make too much of a worry for the user but won’t feel as intense as a puzzle of the first one where there is a chase happening. The puzzle will include simple maths and will have hints around the room that help the user understand how to solve the answers, the hints are specifically there to help the user understand some conversions to hexadecimal and more. The questions will be tested to make sure that they aren’t too tough for kids to handle but can be done.
Upon getting through all the puzzles and the maze they will face a final boss, the boss will have 3 phases, 1 will be where the character will be chased again and make it through a maze however there are more than one beast now. 2 There will be a puzzle with a timer and the puzzle must be solved within a certain amount of time and escape where they get trapped after running away from the beast from the maze in 1. Then 3 the user will come down to the final stand with just a boss battle with some simple mechanics while the user is dealing the final blow. The boss phase will be more forgiving given how much difficulty there is in completing all of the phases at once and will have checkpoints making it more easy.
From completing this they would have beat the game. More can be added in time but for just opening the game it would start off simple then have more added onto it, as most roblox games are agile developed.

<h2>
  Tools and technologies
</h2>
<p>
  The tools and technologies used are; roblox studio (special development tool), some of the modelling systems used in roblox, possibly pre-made decals or make our own. This must also be made / created on a computer because this development tool is not supported for mobile. The only time open source tools would be used is for some models, templates, land or more which are provided by roblox and or users of roblox. It is very easy to download this software as it is a couple clicks and once it is installed it works out of the box, you must have logged into roblox online in order to get it though.

<h2>
  Skills required
</h2>
<p>
  The skills required to pull this off is; the learning of Lua which is the coding language that roblox uses to create their game, coding the physics / logic of models and aspects of a game, understanding good GUI (graphical user interface), designing models, creation of new resources, working as a team, because making a game by yourself is very difficult and will take a lot of time. I think that the skills required are feasible because Lua is mostly used in programming games, and designing models brings a sense of originality and something new to the game.
