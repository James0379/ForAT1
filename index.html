				<h2>My interest in IT</h2>
			</header>
			<p>when i was 4 i got my first PC which was a laptop and have loved using technology since then. In highschool one of the first electives that i picked was IT in year 9 and 10, then in year 11 and 12 i picked SDD (software design and development), i also wanted IPT (information process technology) however only one of these could run at the time and SDD had the majority pick. My interest in IT has come from gaming, the use of computers when i was younger, my dad, and liking to code. I also have built my own pc and rebuilt pc's back in highschool. I chose to come to RMIT because my dad had work down in Melbourne and the offers from Sydney were very slow, the first offers handed to me were RMIT before any other university. My IT experiences include: Python for 3 years, C# for a year, and a bit of Lua not much but still learning. In my studies I expect to learn some new languages relating to web development and coding, possibly more teamwork, and expand my skills for going to a job.

<p>
  The position in this job is a higher up of the developer group that has knowledge and experience that can help others in many different areas, and also improve the business.
  This job appeals to me because for now what I think I want to do is keep working with coding and further expand my current skills to a wider scope.
  What is required for this position is skills like; C#, .net core, Microsoft Azure, SQL / knowledge of databases, JavaScript / NodeJS, and lots of knowledge that has been gathered over the years that can be passed on to the juniors working. And lots of experience with jobs, working with groups.
  The current experience i have right now includes: Some experience with C# (1 years experience), decent experience with Microsoft Azure, still learning SQL, and knowledge with python.
  I will obtain these skills by working up my experience first with jobs then as I get more experienced I could learn the languages and possibly go for a job to learn new languages or skills and expand on my current skill set to get closer to the end goal. Specifically the learning of javascript, .net core, SQL, knowledge of working for more than a couple decades, and more knowledge of working as a team.
