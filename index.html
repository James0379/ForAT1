				<h2>My interest in IT</h2>
			</header>
			<p>when i was 4 i got my first PC which was a laptop and have loved using technology since then. In highschool one of the first electives that i picked was IT in year 9 and 10, then in year 11 and 12 i picked SDD (software design and development), i also wanted IPT (information process technology) however only one of these could run at the time and SDD had the majority pick. My interest in IT has come from gaming, the use of computers when i was younger, my dad, and liking to code. I chose to come to RMIT because my dad had work down in Melbourne and the offers from Sydney were very slow, the first offers handed to me were RMIT before any other university. My IT experiences include: Python for 3 years, C# for a year, and a bit of Lua roughly half a year (still learning). In my studies I expect to learn some new languages relating to web development and coding, possibly more teamwork, and expand my skills for going to a job.
