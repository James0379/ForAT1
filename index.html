    <p style="color:white;"> My interest in IT: when i was 4 i got my first PC which was a laptop and have loved using technology since then. In highschool one of the first electives that i picked was IT, then in year 11 and 12 i picked SDD (software design and development), i also wanted IPT (information process technology) however only one of these could run at the time and SDD had the majority pick. Since high school, obviously most people have a rough idea of what they want to do or they spend the time after high school figuring out what they want to do. I knew that I wanted to go into IT because I enjoy it and have an interest in it. What also helps is that my dad has also gone down the same path as me 35 years ago. My dad currently works as a senior analyst programmer and can do many roles within IT. This would be my ideal job however this takes many years of experience so I plan to start out with a smaller job like junior developer.
